## The Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Description

Given a starter code, I'm creating a calender app as a part of the week 5 challenge assignment.

Looking more in-depthly into API's, this week I'm focused on taking a pre-existing web application and changes it into a working calnder app for simplicity. Applying boostrap as a way to simplifying code insertion and management.
